## What PWACommerce enables you to do

### Progressive Web Apps

Some of the key features of progressive web apps are:

- **Add to Homescreen**. Readers can add the mobile web application to their homescreen and run it in full-screen mode, making it easy to launch and return to your app.

- Smooth animations, scrolling and navigations keep the experience silky smooth.

- **Responsive UI**. The mobile web application is sensitive to various screen sizes and orientation changes: landscape, portrait. In other words, the look and feel of the mobile web app seamlessly morphs into the screen size of users’ devices.

- **App Themes**. You can offer your users an exceptional buying experience by giving them a mobile web application with a native app-like look & feel. The default theme comes with basic features/options, but more app themes will be made available at PWACommerce.com.

- **Analytics**. PWACommerce easily integrates with Google Analytics.


PWACommerce also comes with a **PRO version** suitable for online stores that want to take full advantage of the Progressive Web App technology and increase engagement and conversions. Some of the benefits of using the PRO edition are:

- **Offline Mode**. The app's shell and content is cached using service workers. Categories and products are saved in the browser’s local storage while your users navigate through the app, together with products added to the shopping cart. This offers a full app-like experience to your users, allowing them to continue using the app even when they don't have a network connection.

- **Web Push Notifications**. We have integrated with the OneSignal WordPress plugin, allowing you to engage users through push notifications. This is one of the most requested PWA features, proven to increase user engagement by up to 4x.

- We take pride in offering fantastic maintenance and hands-on support. Our team of friendly progressive web app experts makes sure technology doesn't stand in your way.

- Access to multiple app themes that can be purchased individually or as a bundle.

Your mobile users will be able to benefit from a rich mobile buying experience on their favorite mobile device without needing to go through an App Store and install anything.

## Future Roadmap

Our plan for PWACommerce is to continue integrating with the WooCommerce REST API, for example adding support for pages or writing product reviews directly from the app.

We enjoy writing and maintaining this plugin. If you like it too, please rate us. But if you don’t, let us know how we can improve it.

Have fun on your mobile adventures!
