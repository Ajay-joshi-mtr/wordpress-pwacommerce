WooCommerce mobile plugin to package your online store into a Progressive Web App. Multiple WooCommerce Mobile App Themes Available.

== Description ==

**[PWACommerce](https://pwacommerce.com) is a mobile plugin that helps you transform your WooCommerce shop into a progressive mobile web application. It comes with multiple ecommerce app themes that you can purchase individually or as a bundle.**

PWACommerce is **supported on** iOS and Android smartphones and tablets. **Compatible browsers**: Safari, Google Chrome, Android - Native Browser.

It has been tested on WordPress 4.8 and later. Please read the [Known issues and limitations](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwacommerce/other_notes/) list before installing.

What the PWACommerce enables you to do:

* **Progressive Web Apps**. Some of the key features of progressive web apps are:

 1. Apps load nearly instantly and are reliable, no matter what kind of network connection your user is on.

 1. Smooth animations, scrolling, and navigations keep the experience silky smooth.
 1. Responsive UI.

* **Responsive UI**. The mobile web application is sensitive to various screen sizes and orientation changes: landscape, portrait. In other words, the look and feel of the mobile web app seamlessly morphs into the screen size of users' devices.

* **App Themes**. You can offer your users an exceptional buying experience by giving them a mobile web application with a native app-like look & feel. The default theme comes with basic features/options, but more app themes will be made available at [PWACommerce.com](https://pwacommerce.com).

* **Analytics**. PWACommerce easily integrates with Google Analytics.

* **Add to Homescreen**. Readers can add the mobile web application to their homescreen and run it in full-screen mode.

PWACommerce also comes with a  **PRO version** suitable for **online stores** that want to take full advantage of the Progressive Web App technology and increase engagement and conversions. Some of the benefits of using [PWACommerce.com](https://pwacommerce.com) are:

* **Customize your mobile web app's appearance** to resemble your store's identity.

* We take pride in offering fantastic [PWACommerce](https://pwacommerce.com) **maintenance and hands-on support**. Our team of friendly progressive web app experts makes sure technology doesn't stand in your way.

* **Access to multiple app themes** that can be purchased individually or as a bundle.

* Your mobile users will be able to benefit from a rich mobile buying experience on their favorite mobile device without needing to go through an App Store and install anything.

Ideally, use a real mobile device to access your (public) site address and check that mobile web app works correctly.

You can also download a number of mobile emulators that can run on a desktop PC and simulate mobile devices.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What devices and operating systems are supported by my mobile web application?
PWAcommerce is supported on iOS and Android smartphones. Compatible browsers: Safari, Google Chrome, Android - Native Browser.

= What is the difference between my new mobile web application and a mobile friendly site? =
The short answer is that a mobile web application is an enriched version of a mobile-friendly site; it's not only about screen size, it's also about functionality (offline mode, for example). The long answer comes in a form of an article, you can check it out here: http://www.appticles.com/blog/2014/05/mobile-web-dying-shifting/.

= What is the difference between my mobile web application and a responsive theme? =
A responsive theme is all about screen-size: it loads the same styling as the desktop view, adjusting it to fit a smaller screen. On the other hand a mobile web application combines the versatility of the web with the functionality of touch-enabled devices and can support native app-like features such as:

1. Apps load nearly instantly and are reliable, no matter what kind of network connection your user is on.
1.  Web app install banners give users the ability to quickly and seamlessly add your mobile app to their home screen, making it easy to launch and return to your app.
1.  Smooth animations, scrolling, and navigations keep the experience silky Smooth.


= What is a progressive web app? =
Please refer to this comprehensive article about it: https://www.appticles.com/blog/2016/09/progressive-web-apps-for-publishers/.

= Why some 3rd party plugins are not visible on any of the app themes? =
There are almost 50,000 plugins in the WordPress.org repository. It's impossible to support all of them. [Please get in touch](http://pwacommerce.com/contact/) if you want us to integrate with another 3rd party plugin.
